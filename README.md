## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

As one of the industries expanded by the advancement of computer technologies
such as computer vision and machine learning in the 21st century, the game
industry has huge commercial value and market. Taking Shanghai, China as
an example, according to the Shanghai Game Publishing Industry Report, the
revenue of the game industry in Shanghai was RMB 125.03 billion, a year-on-
year increase of 3.6%. The related industries driven by the game industry also
have a broad market, such as e-sports events. However, according to the data
in the ”Report”, the number of game users in China will be about 667 million
in 2021, and the growth rate will hit a new low in recent years. This shows that
under the current demographic background, the number of consumers that the
game market can absorb is close to the upper limit. How to attract more new
players or attract players who have played traditional games to try new games
based on the current number of players is a business problem worth solving and
thinking about.
As a game, its goal is to give different feedback and continue to attract
players’ attention through effective interaction with players, motivating players
to continue playing. In a game system, many features can be developed to
attract the player’s attention. The most common way is by giving players a
certain number of rewards. However, this method also has limitations. After
the player receives a certain number of rewards, the player will be tired of the
rewards given by the game, such as medals and special items. Players will be
less interested in the game.
To solve this problem, our team decided to slow down the decay rate of
players’ interest by modifying the interaction between the system and players
based on the perspective of the game system and player interaction. Traditional
games accept the user’s keyboard/handle or mouse as input to interact with the
user. In our system, we will analyze the user’s intention by collecting the user’s
picture information, so that the user can play different games without the need
for external input devices such as a keyboard, mouse or gamepad.
In this system, we utilize the techniques learned in the ISS course by inte-
grating a real-time user hand information collection module, a user hand feature
extraction module, a user intent analysis module, a user background replace-
ment module, and three independent interactive game modules - Snake, rocket
dodging obstacles and quiz games and user rights management modules to de-
velop intelligent game systems.
At the same time, with the improvement of people’s consumption level, more
and more enterprises attach importance to brand management. Including, but
not limited to, almost 15% annual increase in papers at HCI conferences us-
ing interactive techniques to improve users’ perception of corporate branding.
Based on this, we propose our system’s application scenarios and business value.
In popular restaurants or shopping malls, customers’ children will be dissatisfied
due to long waiting (such as waiting for customers to pay remaining for cus-
tomers to shop); we hope to provide our game system allows customers’ children
to be quiet and patient during the waiting period, thereby improving customersatisfaction and ultimately improving the corporate brand image.
The role of interaction is far more significant than our imagination. We
believe that our system has great potential in the future. It may be able to
provide new ideas for game companies to promote games. Imagine the following
scenario: our software embeds more new games; it can be directly installed on
various machines; then placed in shopping malls or other high-traffic places;
users simply pass in front of it and have a direct opportunity to stop and play
new games with simple finger interaction (avoid learning any game operation,
allowing users to face the game itself directly); we believe that such a new type
of game advertising has excellent value.
